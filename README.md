# ESPFlutDX

A pixelflut client for the ESP32.
This is running on a clone of the FREENOVE ESP32S3-CAM board which has an SD card reader where the image is loaded from. The SD card is connected via 1-bit SDMMC.

## Files
ESPFlutDX.ino should be the slightly faster client, meanwhile ESPFlutDX_simple.ino is simpler but its slower and unoptimized.
ESPFlutDX_CAM uses the camera of the S3 board im using, its a bit iffy so i dont really recommend using it
