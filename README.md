# ESPFlutDX

A pixelflut client for the ESP32.
This is running on a clone of the FREENOVE ESP32S3-CAM board which has an SD card reader where the image is loaded from. The SD card is connected via 1-bit SDMMC.

## Files
ESPFlutDX.ino is unfinished and should not be used yet, ESPFlutDX_simple.ino works and its very simple but its rather slow and unoptimized.
